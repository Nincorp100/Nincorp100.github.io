During this time, gaming had been primarily composed of soldiers, monsters, and guns, with strong male protagonists like Doomguy and Duke Nukem being well-known iconic staples for their general baddassery, and with female characters in the scene such as Lara Croft being exploited by publisher marketing tactics, using sexual appeal as a selling point, despite artist Toby Gard&rsquo;s disapproval, stating they were taking away from Lara&rsquo;s character and peddling her as eye candy. While designing Lara, Gard wanted to create a strong, independent, intelligent female lead who would challenge the expectations of what was normalized in gaming culture, where most female characters were often portrayed as fragile, helpless, and in need of protection. While Gard continued to build up Lara&rsquo;s character, publisher Eidos took the easy route of marketing, cashing in on the appeal that a female character in a tank top and shorts would have for the male gaze, especially in further installments, when marketing for the Tomb Raider games including images of Lara in a bikini, or wetsuit, with beckoning messaging, such as PC Gamer issue 39 featuring a bikini-clad Lara looking back at the reader with a blurb reading &ldquo;The toughest action hero in PC gaming returns in Eidos&rsquo; jaw-dropping </span><span class="c0 c1">Tomb Raider 2</span><span class="c0">! Our eight-page exclusive (</span><span class="c10">with plenty more pictures!</span><span class="c2 c0">) starts on page 70&hellip;&rdquo; (Dales). Eidos had sacrificed Lara&rsquo;s characterization for visual appeal and had played once again into the male-dominated gaming space&rsquo;s ideology.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Lara Croft was betrayed by her publisher, there was another female lead like her at this time, with most of the same traits: strong, independent, intelligent, and courageous, and who shared similar game mechanics, who thankfully avoided this type of exploitation. This character was the self-titled heroine of Electronic Arts&rsquo; unique 2000 staple, </span><span class="c0 c1">American McGee&rsquo;s Alice</span><span class="c0">. American McGee was a game industry pioneer who had a hand in shaping the golden years of id Software in the 90s. McGee himself had a rollercoaster of an upbringing before he would professionally step into the industry, with an absentee father who, upon meeting for essentially the first time during American&rsquo;s teen years, beat McGee and then exited his life once again, and a carefree, hippie mother who constantly cycled through partners, having American grow up in an unstable home environment. A 16-year-old McGee would come home one day and find his home emptied, aside from his belongings, discovering his mother had sold everything, including the house, to move and pay for her newest partner&rsquo;s gender affirming surgery (Saint). Between dropping out of high school and working odd jobs, McGee would spend his time coding small adventure games on his Commodore 64. As McGee was working at an auto shop at 21, he moved to an apartment complex and met his neighbor, John Carmack, of id Software. McGee and Carmack got along well, with Carmack bringing McGee on board to work in tech support, which didn&rsquo;t last long until he was promoted to work on level design for multiple installments in the </span><span class="c0 c1">Doom</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c1">Quake</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;series. In 1998, McGee was fired from id, citing &ldquo;internal politics&rdquo; as the reasoning behind the decision to let him go.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGee quotes the day he got fired as one of the &ldquo;most meaningful days&rdquo; to him. Mixed between the fear of being cast back out into the world, but having the experience of his time at id, helped McGee to continue pursuing his passion in game design. Not long after he departed from id, McGee was contacted by Michael Crichton to work on the design for a project based on Crichton&rsquo;s novel </span><span class="c0 c1">Timeline</span><span class="c0">, which would be published by Electronic Arts. McGee was approached by EA, who offered him the opportunity to work for them as a development reviewer (Arcade Attack Retro Gaming Network). McGee would work up to pitching </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with help from artists Terry Smith and Norman Felch, who helped map out the artistic direction and Alice&rsquo;s design, respectively, as well as McGee&rsquo;s creative partner, R.J. Berg, who helped formulate the narrative. In a later interview, McGee comments that </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;was EA&rsquo;s first M-rated title, and while working on the story, McGee and Berg both took extreme care when adding in the twisted horror elements to still stay authentic to Alice&rsquo;s character, and to work their story to still be accurate to the original works, but adding enough to make it their tale (Kohler).</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;begins shortly after the events of </span><span class="c0 c1">Through the Looking Glass, </span><span class="c2 c0">with the Liddell family: a 7-year-old Alice, her cat Dinah, and her parents, sleeping in their home. Something startles Dinah, and she knocks over an oil lamp, burning the Liddell house down, with a young Alice, scarred and burned, being the sole survivor. Alice, having shut down mentally due to trauma, survivor&rsquo;s guilt, and major injuries, has been admitted to Rutledge Asylum for 10 years in a catatonic state. One night, she is pulled back into Wonderland by her stuffed toy rabbit, who speaks with the White Rabbit&rsquo;s voice, begging for her help to save Wonderland. Within the game&rsquo;s physical materials, a casebook by Alice&rsquo;s doctor, Heironymous Q. Wilson, is included. The casebook (realistically written by Greg Roensch) goes on to discuss Alice&rsquo;s time at the asylum after the fire, noting how her severe burns miraculously healed over time, and describing her dementia-like state of mind, giving no reaction to outside stimulation. The casebook describes most of what is happening in the real world, including all of the treatments such as bloodletting, elixirs, and electroshock that Alice is physically enduring, all while the player is battling through Wonderland.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We join Alice as she mentally falls </span><span class="c0">back </span><span class="c0">into </span><span class="c0">Wonderland</span><span class="c0">. We meet Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat, and are introduced to our game mechanics. Alice&rsquo;s health bar is dubbed &ldquo;sanity&rdquo;, and her ability power (mana, as it&rsquo;s widely referred to) is dubbed &ldquo;willpower&rdquo;. Already, we see that the game is played through Alice&rsquo;s psyche, with her resolve being the true force pushing her forward in her adventure. As we come across our first weapon, the Vorpal Blade, a knife with a crooked blade, we get our first glance at how Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s tale has been twisted in this version of Wonderland. Many of Alice&rsquo;s weapons (or toys, as they are called) are picked out of Carroll&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice in Wonderland</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c1">Through the Looking Glass,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;both directly and indirectly. The Vorpal Blade (originally the vorpal </span><span class="c0 c1">sword</span><span class="c0">) comes straight out of Carroll&rsquo;s poem </span><span class="c0 c1">The Jabberwocky</span><span class="c0">: &ldquo;One, two! One, two! And through and through/ The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!/ He left it dead, and with its head/ He went galumphing back.&rdquo; (Carroll 134). While not directly ripped from Alice&rsquo;s adventure, the other tools in her toybox draw inspiration from the classic tale, such as the dodo croquet mallet that reflects the Red Queen&rsquo;s croquet game, or the deck of playing cards, which draws from the different suits of cards within the Queen&rsquo;s kingdom. </span><span class="c0">The thematic change from the industry standard weapons to lethal children&rsquo;s toys shows how Alice uses her childhood playthings, a sign of the happier and brighter times of her life, to battle the darkness that has overshadowed her mental state.</span><span class="c0 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At its core, the combat of </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">incorporates some </span><span class="c0">of the classic </span><span class="c0">mechanics and styles of the </span><span class="c0">first-person shooters of </span><span class="c0">the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;time, albeit with a third-person camera angle and a glowing reticle to help with aiming and platforming. Most of the toys Alice uses </span><span class="c0">have some similarities to the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;common weapons seen in other titles of the time, such as the knife being your typical melee weapon, the deck of cards being an automatic gun, and the ice staff being a flamethrower. The art team wanted to find a way to incorporate weapons into Alice&rsquo;s arsenal, but </span><span class="c0">also</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;have them fit into the setting of Wonderland, hence the conception of the toybox of tools Alice has at her disposal. The combat in the game is extremely engaging, but it has some fights that feel a bit overwhelming and impossible. The one enemy type in the game that is the most difficult to deal with is the Snark, an aquatic, almost angler-like fish that has different variations in different levels. While swimming underwater, Alice is only able to utilize her Vorpal Blade, making the underwater fights against packs of Snarks incredibly tense. If you try to avoid the water where you can, Snarks can stretch their tongue out and grab Alice, pulling her into the water (or lava, in later levels) and swarming her en masse. Other enemy types, such as the card guards or the demonic Boojums, are fairly manageable, with the only other one that demands concern being the Phantasmagoria (also named after a Carroll poem), a ghostly apparition that cloaks itself in invisibility until Alice gets close enough, to which it decloaks and attacks. The Phantasmagoria can freeze Alice in place for a short time, which causes more concern in larger fights when the ghoul is joined by other enemies, who take the opportunity to deal out damage. If a player is observant, however, they can notice that the Phantasmagoria&rsquo;s ice chain attack also affects enemies, which opens up a new tactic that they can use in larger fights, momentarily taking an enemy out of the fray, so the player can focus on other dangers.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corruption of Alice&rsquo;s mental state has deformed old, well-known faces to menacing monsters, and the Duchess, alongside the Mad Hatter and the Tweedles, are now avatars of Alice&rsquo;s trauma. The Duchess, now a ruthless cannibal with a never-ending hunger, seeks to devour any creature who gets in her way, such in the way Alice&rsquo;s survivor&rsquo;s guilt continues to endlessly eat away at her sanity, as if nothing is safe or sacred within her mind, the Tweedles, who harass Alice and threaten her with hints of the same vile treatments she&rsquo;s physically recieving in the real world, and Hatter, who mocks her inability to face the reality of the horrific accident that claimed the lives of her parents, and how she shut herself off, both mentally and physically. On the other end, however, Alice still has many friends who stand by her side and wish to see her succeed and the Red Queen fall. Throughout her crusade, Alice will meet with the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, the Mock Turtle, Bill McGill, the Caterpillar, the Dormouse, the March Hare, and the Gryphon, all of whom have some impact on her resolve and determination to end her mental suffering, if not for herself, then for her tortured friends. The design of Wonderland&rsquo;s denizens is wholly unique, with some critics joking that </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;comes off more Tim Burton-esque than Burton&rsquo;s actual take on the story in the 2010 Disney film adaptation, with characters having disproportionate features and abnormal visages. These varying appearances, while unique to McGee&rsquo;s interpretation, still mostly have a grounding in the origin of the characters from Carroll&rsquo;s tale.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;s level design is unique, with The Pale Realm being one of the greatest levels in the game. The Pale Realm is chess-themed, with the buildings being devoid of colour and the ground and sky being composed of black and white chessboard textures. Later in the level, Alice raids the Red King&rsquo;s domain, which, instead of the white/black aesthetic the Pale Realm had, consists of red and black colouring. Multiple times in the realm, Alice is turned into a chess piece, and must complete a traversal puzzle, only being able to move with the same movement as the chess piece she is (I.E. only being able to move in an &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape as a knight, or only moving diagonally as a bishop). These traversal puzzles, although brief, demonstrate the genius of integrating the setting into the gameplay and provide a variety of mechanics throughout the level. This is the most intricate level design within </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">, with the only other levels having unique mechanics being the Hatter&rsquo;s domain and its clock puzzles, which sees Alice destroying clocks scattered through the level to open up paths to advance further, and Queensland&rsquo;s twisting hedgemazes, which span multiple areas and can be disorienting to navigate, all while enemies drop in from the top of the maze and swarm Alice. The general level design in </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has a mixture of platforming, puzzles, and combat. Platforming is accomplished by including a footstep icon on Alice&rsquo;s reticle when looking at the floor, indicating where she&rsquo;ll land if she jumps. In some areas, Alice can rope climb, and is also capable of grabbing onto a ledge and climbing up, which is necessary for some platforming levels, such as the Fortress of Doors or the Skool, and is reminiscent of the platforming mechanics from </span><span class="c0 c1">Tomb Raider</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as well, yet again solidifying the inspiration Lara Croft has had on </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;and other future female action protagonists. At the end of the Pale Realm level, Alice squares off against the Red King, and after prevailing against him, presents a white pawn given to her by the White King, which reincarnates as the White Queen, akin to the chess rules of a pawn reaching the opposite end of the board, and yet another way the level incorporates the chess theme into the narrative. </span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">While Alice may face plenty of villains across her trek in Wonderland, the Insane Children (as they are referred to in-game), whom she encounters in Hatter&rsquo;s Domain, are just as much victims of the insanity as Alice is, with mechanical apparatuses equipped on their heads, and various other scars from the experimenting Hatter has performed on them. Hatter&rsquo;s Domain is sickening, potentially showing how Alice&rsquo;s subconscious is interpreting what is going on in the asylum around her in reality. The insane children desperately call out for help, with some exhibiting different psychological disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and mania, to name a few. Their screams and sounds will haunt the soundscape of the level, and are unsettling to both Alice and the player. In an essay about mental health in </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">, Rachel Flory, in regards to the Hatter&rsquo;s Domain level, says, &ldquo;During a mini-boss battle in this section, Tweedledee and Tweedledum mock Alice, calling her a lunatic&hellip; I remember that resonated with me especially&mdash;I had been mocked by a classmate earlier that year for having a panic attack in the middle of class. He called me &ldquo;psycho,&rdquo; and I was a wreck for like two weeks about it&hellip; After the battle with the Tweedles, the Mad Hatter appears and further taunts Alice about how much she fears facing the truth of what caused her hospitalization, and the memories of grief and loss. It was around this point in the game that I had decided Alice and I were fighting similar battles. Like Alice, depression and trauma had turned my inner Wonderland into a hellish prison. I was trapped inside my mind and couldn&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo; (Flory). Flory captures what </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was able to accomplish in its presentation- a visual representation of the internal struggle of someone coping with trauma, depression, and/or grief. This is an aspect of the game that was highly praised in the game&rsquo;s theme, as it shows a purely serious depiction of mental health, without making light of the weight it carries on Alice&rsquo;s mind. The classic tales of Alice in Wonderland are well-known, &nbsp;as well as how she beat the Red Queen during her first venture, and helped anyone that she was able to along the way, but in reality, Alice was just a normal girl with a wildly vivid imagination. In the case of American McGee&rsquo;s interpretation, Wonderland is Alice&rsquo;s coping mechanism. In both entries in the series, </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c1">Madness Returns</span><span class="c0">, real-life Alice Liddell is disheveled, with thin, ragged clothes and dark circles under her eyes, but in both instances, when she falls into Wonderland, she blossoms into a healthier appearance, with a clear face, clean hair, and her signature blue and white dress. Alice still mentally views herself as the strong figure who can take on the challenges presented to her. Again, in Wilson&rsquo;s casebook, he mentions times when Alice, after long periods of inactivity or unreactiveness, would draw images, which were of the various places she visits in the game, such as the Village of the Doomed, Skool, Hatter&rsquo;s Domain, and Queensland. Alice fights not only to free her Wonderland but to unshackle herself from her PTSD and survivor&rsquo;s guilt. Alice soon reaches the Jabberwock, a nightmare being and the Queen&rsquo;s most powerful champion, who is the embodiment of Alice&rsquo;s guilt. It begins to verbally assault her, mocking her trauma and blaming her for the death of her family because she was &ldquo;busy in dreamland taking tea with her friends&rdquo;. Aside from the Red Queen </span><span class="c0">herself</span><span class="c0">, The Jabberwock was the ultimate hurdle that Alice had to face, as it was the one who pulled all of her inner turmoil and cascading thoughts out of the darkness of her mind, putting them on full display and making her confront the trauma that she had witnessed as a child. Building up the last of her resolve, Alice, along with all of the friends she has saved along the way, storms Queensland and puts an end to the twisting madness of the Red Queen. The confidence Alice gains from defeating her in </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;carries over and is prominently displayed by her characterization in </span><span class="c0 c1">Madness Returns</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was incredibly popular at the time, selling over 360k copies by 2007 (Edge Staff), and would go on to have a sequel made by McGee and his new company, Spicy Horse. </span><span class="c0 c1">Madness Returns</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would go on to have ports on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and would include </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as an add-on accessible through the main menu. While being ported alongside </span><span class="c0 c1">Madness Returns</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would still have some issues, as the ports were not remasters or upgrades, just the original game, and so would fall into a bit more obscurity among the growing popularity of its sequel. After </span><span class="c0 c1">Madness Returns</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was released in 2011, McGee tried to spread the </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;IP to different media, originally planning a film project with alleged ties to horror legend Wes Craven as director, and even crowdfunded two shorts called </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice: Otherworlds</span><span class="c0">, seeing Alice meeting Jules Verne and Richard Wagner. While in a longstanding back and forth with Electronic Arts about making a third entry in the series titled </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice: Asylum</span><span class="c0">, McGee, along with his creative team, had written up a 400+ page design bible at EA&rsquo;s request, featuring the full laid-out story, level and character designs, the enemies and weapons Alice would encounter, and all the concept art included. This bible would be shared with the Patreon supporters who pledged support for the third entry, and eventually would be accessible for free to everyone. While McGee had put all this effort into drafting up the concept for </span><span class="c0 c1">Asylum</span><span class="c0">, in 2023, an announcement was made on the Patreon page that McGee and EA had come to an unfortunate conclusion. EA had replied to McGee that they were no longer interested in supporting a third installment, and would not be willing to part with the </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;IP (EA still being the owners of the IP was the only obstacle in McGee&rsquo;s way to making the game on his own or finding a different publisher. With that response, McGee had also announced his retirement from the game industry, citing EA&rsquo;s decision as well as spending more time with his family as the reason. While we may never see the third </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;game come to fruition, the legacy McGee has left with </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c1">Madness Returns</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;will continue as a cult classic, and a beautiful, tragic breakaway from the mainstream of the games industry.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0 c1">American McGee&rsquo;s Alice </span><span class="c0">deserves to be remembered, and while it may have been overshadowed by some of the popular titles of the time, it not only took the staple mechanics and ideas from those titles, but paved the way for unique stories and designs for games, encouraging other studios to be unique with their projects. </span><span class="c0 c1">Alice</span><span class="c0">, with the help of what </span><span class="c0 c1">Tomb Raider</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;set out to create, also helped carve a path for future female protagonists in the genre. McGee deserves praise for the dedication to continuing Alice&rsquo;s story in his iteration, while still staying true to the heart of Carroll&rsquo;s timeless tale. McGee and the other staff had also gone to meticulous lengths to accurately portray the hardships and seriousness of those suffering from psychological issues, and that regardless of whatever their ailment might be, they are still people deserving of a happy ending. </span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0">Arcade Attack Retro Gaming Network. &ldquo;The Making of DOOM, Quake &amp; American McGee&#39;s Alice - American McGee Interview.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0 c1">YouTube</span><span class="c2 c0">, 17 November 2024, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl2UtXdAWZM.
